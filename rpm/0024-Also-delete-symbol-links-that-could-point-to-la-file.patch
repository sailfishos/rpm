Subject: [PATCH] Also delete symbol links that could point to la-files
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

la files can be shipped as symbolic links and as file.
Both should be deleted and the symbolic link shouldn't be followed
as it will be invalid.
