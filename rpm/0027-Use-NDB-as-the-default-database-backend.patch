Subject: [PATCH] Use NDB as the default database backend

Up to and including rpm 4.16 the default backend was dbd.
The default changed to sqlite in rpm 4.17, but we are using ndb for now.
We want to avoid adding more packages to prjconf `Preinstall`,
which would add to build time and possibly affect build loop as well.
